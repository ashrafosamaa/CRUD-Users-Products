# CRUD-Users-Products

 * using express and mysql2 *
I created some APIs 
1) User:
   add user (user must not found before)
   update user 
   delete user(user must be found)
   get all user 
   get all users with products
   search for user where his name start with "a" and age less than 30 => using like for characters
   search for users by list of ids => using IN

2) Product
    add product(product must not found before)
    delete product (product owner only can do this and product must be found )
    update product (product owner only)
    get all products 
    search for products where price greater than 3000
